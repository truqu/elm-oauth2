module OAuth.Implicit
    exposing
        ( authorize
        , parse
        )

{-| The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not
support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public clients known to operate a
particular redirection URI. These clients are typically implemented in a browser using a
scripting language such as JavaScript.

This is a 2-step process:

  - The client asks for an authorization and implicit authentication to the OAuth provider: the user is redirected.
  - The provider redirects the user back and the client parses the request query parameters from the url.

After those steps, the client owns an `access_token` that can be used to authorize any subsequent
request.
