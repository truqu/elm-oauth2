{-| Utility library to manage client-side OAuth 2.0 authentications

The library contains a main OAuth module exposing types used accross other modules. In practice,
you'll only need tu use one of the additional modules:

  - OAuth.AuthorizationCode: The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens
    and refresh tokens via a redirection-based flow and is optimized for confidential clients
    [4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).

  - OAuth.Implicit: The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not support the
    issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public clients known to operate a particular
    redirection URI [4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2).

  - OAuth.Password: The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases where the
    resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as the device operating system or a
    highly privileged application [4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)

  - OAuth.ClientCredentials: The client can request an access token using only its client credentials
    (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected
    resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged
    with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification)
    [4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3).

In practice, you most probably want to use the *OAuth.Implicit* module which is the most commonly
used.

    The lifetime in seconds of the access token. For example, the value "3600" denotes that the
    access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. If omitted, the
    authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or document the default
    value.

  - refreshToken (*OPTIONAL*):
    The refresh token, which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the same authorization
    grant as described in [Section 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6).

  - scope (*OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested; otherwise, REQUIRED*):
    The scope of the access token as described by [Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

    shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks. A maximum authorization code lifetime of
    10 minutes is RECOMMENDED. The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once. If an
    authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and
    SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on that authorization code. The
    authorization code is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.

    A single ASCII error code.

  - errorDescription (*OPTIONAL*)
    Human-readable ASCII text providing additional information, used to assist the client developer in
    understanding the error that occurred. Values for the `errorDescription` parameter MUST NOT
    include characters outside the set `%x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E`.

  - errorUri (*OPTIONAL*):
    A URI identifying a human-readable web page with information about the error, used to
    provide the client developer with additional information about the error. Values for the
    `errorUri` parameter MUST conform to the URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT include
    characters outside the set `%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E`.

{-| Describes an OAuth error response [4.1.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1)

  - InvalidRequest: The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value,
    includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.

  - UnauthorizedClient: The client is not authorized to request an authorization code using this
    method.

  - AccessDenied: The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.

  - UnsupportedResponseType: The authorization server does not support obtaining an authorization code
    using this method.

  - InvalidScope: The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

  - ServerError: The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
    fulfilling the request. (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status
    code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)

  - TemporarilyUnavailable: The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to
    a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. (This error code is needed because a 503
    Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)
